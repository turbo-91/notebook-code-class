# Challenges: npm and Linting Basics

## Terrible Template

One of our coaches (we won't say any names...) prepared a terrible template. Its supposed to toggle
3 buttons with links to 3 really cool websites. The websites provide APIs for us to build exciting
Apps. But nothing seems to be working. Luckily you can use the linters, which are already installed
in this template, to fix the buttons.

1. Follow [this link](https://github.com/spiced-academy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/linting-basics-template) to open the template.
2. Click on the button `Use this template`. Set the Owner as your own username and select a
   repository name. Select the `Public` radio button and click on
   `Create a repository from this template`.
3. Clone the repository and open it locally in VS Code.
4. After opening the repository, run the command `npm install`
5. Check the package.json, which will provide information on the commands you can use to start the linters.

> ❗️ Remember to run `npm install`!

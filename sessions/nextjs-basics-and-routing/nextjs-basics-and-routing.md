### Difference between a Library and a Framework

Next.js is a React framework, i.e. it is built on top of the React library. Both, a library as well as a framework, are reusable code written by someone else. Their purpose is to help you solve common problems in easier ways.

When using a library, you are in control which parts of the code you use and when. In contrast, a framework like Next.js is more rigid: you only have a few limited choices when and how to use the given code. If you accept these limitations, a framework takes a lot of work off your hands in the background.

### What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast web applications. These building blocks provide pre-built solutions for the main concepts you will encounter when building modern applications, such as user interface, routing, data fetching, infrastructure, etc.

### Which Features of Next.js are we going to use in the Bootcamp?

Next.js will help us with the following topics:

- A template to use as a starting point
- A bundler, transpiler and development server
- Routing: Navigate between pages, Dynamic Routing
- Auto-optimized images
- API Routes

> ðŸ“™ Next.js has a lot more to offer, which is why it is such a popular framework. To get an impression of all features, [have a quick look at the documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

### How to Next.js: Basics

#### Differences to Create React App

Here you can see a comparison of some relevant differences between Next.js and Create React App (CRA):

|                        | Next.js (new)                    | Create React App (old) |
| ---------------------: | -------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Start local dev server | `npm run dev`                    | `npm run start`        |
|         Root component | `_app.js`                        | `App.js`               |
|               Document | `_document.js`                   | `public/index.html`    |
|        Default styling | CSS Modules\*                    | CSS\*                  |
|              Rendering | Server and Client Side           | Client Side            |
|       Route definition | file structure in `pages` folder | n/a                    |
|      Client side links | `<Link>` component               | n/a                    |
|     Image optimization | `<Image>` component              | n/a                    |
|     Modifying `<head>` | `<Head>` component               | n/a                    |
|           Font loading | `@next/font` package             | n/a                    |
|             API routes | `pages/api` folder               | n/a                    |
|                 ESLint | Next.js specific rules           | CRA specific rules     |
|   Bundler + transpiler | Webpack/Turbopack + SWC          | Webpack + Babel        |

\*Both Next.js and CRA support all modern styling solutions.

#### Server-Side Rendering

With CRA the browser loads an almost empty HTML document (`public/index.html`). Your React code is only executed in the browser.

Next.js comes with a featured called "server-side rendering". This feature will execute your React components on the server to send a complete HTML document to the client (the browser). On the client your React code gets executed again.

This enables a lot of optimization techniques we won't discuss. However, there is one important implication you need to know:

Since your React code is executed in a server environment and not just a browser environment, you need to pay attention when using browser APIs (like `window` or `document`). They are only available in the browser and will break the app on the server. When using a browser API you need to ensure that your code is only executed on the client. For example code inside a `useEffect` hook is only executed on the client, since effects are not executed on the server, but only on the client. Event handlers like `onClick` are also only executed on the client.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  console.log(window.innerWidth);
}, []);

return <button onClick={() => console.log(window.innerWidth)}>Click me</button>;
```

#### Routing

Until now our React applications only ever displayed a single page. The process of conditionally rendering different pages based on the URL (path name) and navigating between these pages ist called routing.

Since a good routing solution is not easy to make, almost all React developers rely on an external routing library. For example `react-router` is a very popular solution.

Next.js provides routing as a built-in feature, so that you don't need another library.

Routing in Next.js is based on the file system in the `pages` folder:

- `pages/index.js` â†’ `/` (`index.js` always implies the root route of a folder)
- `pages/about.js` â†’ `/about`

To support more complex routes, you can create the appropriate nested folder structure:

- `pages/about/me.js` â†’ `/about/me`
- `pages/about/all-others.js` â†’ `/about/all-others`
- `pages/about/some/long/route.js` â†’ `/about/some/long/route`

> ðŸ’¡ You can define dynamic routes (routes that have dynamic parameters) as well. This will be a topic of a future session.

> ðŸ’¡ File based routing can be ambiguous. The files `pages/about/index.js` and `pages/about.js` are both associated with `/about`. In practice, this is rarely a problem. Nevertheless, you should be aware of it.

> ðŸ“™ Read more about [**Routing** in the Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/introduction).

#### `<Link>` component

For client-side transitions between routes, use the `<Link>` component provided by next/link. Given a `pages` directory with

- `pages/index.js`
- `pages/about.js`
- `pages/about/me.js`,

You can link to each of these pages in the following way:

```js
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Navigation() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        <Link href="/">Home</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about">About</Link>
      </li>
      <li>
        <Link href="/about/me">Me</Link>
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ“™ Read more about [**next/link** in the Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/link).

#### Image Optimaization with `next/image`

Next.js comes with automatic image optimization â€“ the next/image component. This feature, for example, avoids shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport and images are lazy-loaded by default. Keep in mind that using `<Image>` comes with a little bit of default styling.

Here's an example implementation. Note that the `height` and `width` props should be the desired rendering size, with an aspect ratio identical to the source image.

```js
import Image from "next/image";

export default function AnimalImage() {
  <Image
    src="/images/a_small_dog.jpg"
    height={144}
    width={144}
    alt="A picture of a small dog"
  />;
}
```

When using images from external domains, you need to configure the allowed domains in the `next.config.js` file:

```js
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ["images.unsplash.com"],
  },
};
```

> ðŸ“™ Read more about [configuring **domains** for next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#domains) and [**next/image** in general in the Next.js Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image).

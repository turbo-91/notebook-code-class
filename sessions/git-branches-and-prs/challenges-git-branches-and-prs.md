# Challenges: Git Branches and PRs

## Session Notebook part 2

Continue to work on your session notebook.

1. First create a new branch called "notes/github-and-markdown".
2. Switch on that branch and start working on the respective session note. Fill the session note
   with short hints and command collections you find helpful.
3. Commit regularly after each step and use **good commit messages**.
4. When you are satisfied with the session note, push the content of the branch to the remote
   repository (`git push -u origin notes/github-and-markdown`).
5. On GitHub, go to the remote repository. A yellow action box should have appeared suggesting to
   create a pull request for the named branch. Create the pull request.
6. Share the link to the pull request with your group so they can review your notes.
7. Merge the pull request or add some suggestions of your group mates.
8. Repeat this workflow with the other session notes you created the last days.

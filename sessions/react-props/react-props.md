## Using Props

Props is short for properties. They are a way to pass data to a child component. A component receives a props object as the first function parameter.

Props are [passed to a component as attributes](#passing-props-to-a-component).

```jsx
function UserCard(props) {
  return <div>{props.name}</div>;
}
```

For convenience the props object is often destructured in the function parameter.

```jsx
function UserCard({ name }) {
  return <div>{name}</div>;
}
```

You can choose any names for your props.

> ðŸ’¡ There are some naming conventions though. Boolean props are often prefixed with `is`, `has` or `should`. For example `isDisabled`, `hasError` or `shouldShow`. Props that take functions are often prefixed with `on`. For example `onClick`, `onSubmit` or `onHover`. Following these conventions makes it easier to understand the purpose of the prop.

Props can be of any type (string, number, array, object, function, ...).

You should treat the props object as immutable and read-only.

## Passing Props to a Component

Props are passed to a component as attributes.

```jsx
<UserCard name="Alex" />
```

You can pass any type of data as a prop.

```jsx
<UserCard
  name="Alex"
  age={25}
  onContact={() => console.log("let's chat!")}
  isFavorite={true}
  favoriteFoods={["Pasta", "Salad"]}
  contactDetails={{ email: "alex@spiced.com", phone: "123456789" }}
/>
```

String props can be passed using double quotes. All other props must be passed using curly braces.

> ðŸ’¡ Notice the double curly braces for the object. This is because the outer curly braces are used to signify a JavaScript expression. The inner curly braces are used to define an object.

> ðŸ’¡ There is a shorthand syntax for boolean props. If the value should be `true` you can omit the value.
>
> ```jsx
> <UserCard isFavorite />
> ```

Omitting any attribute will result in the value `undefined` for that prop.

### Conditional Rendering

You can use props to conditionally render parts of a component.

```jsx
function UserCard({ name, isFavorite }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {name}
      {isFavorite ? <span>ðŸŒŸ</span> : null}
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ In JSX `null` is a way to render nothing.

You can not use an `if` statement within JSX because only expressions are allowed. You can use an `if` statement outside of the JSX though.

```jsx
function UserCard({ name, isFavorite }) {
  let favoriteStar = null;
  if (isFavorite) {
    favoriteStar = <span>ðŸŒŸ</span>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      {name}
      {favoriteStar}
    </div>
  );
}
```

# React Nesting

## Learning Objectives

- Understanding the concept of nesting
- Creating multiple custom components to create a hierarchy
- Using the `children` prop to render JSX from the parent component
- Understanding composition as a way to build complex components

## Passing JSX as Props

Elements created by JSX are just objects. They can be passed around like any other object: for example, as props.

```jsx
function UserCard({ avatar }) {
  return <div className="card">{avatar}</div>;
}
```

```jsx
function App() {
  return <UserCard avatar={<Avatar />} />;
}
```

## The `children` Prop

You are already familiar with nesting built-in browser tags:

```js
<div>
  <img />
</div>
```

Oftentimes you'd want your own components to be nestable as well.

```jsx
<UserCard>
  <Avatar />
</UserCard>
```

If you nest a component inside of another component, the nested component is passed as a prop to the parent component. This special prop is called `children`.

```jsx
function UserCard({ children }) {
  return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
}
```

This component will render the nested element(s) as a child of the `div` element.

> ðŸ’¡ The nested element(s) can be a single element, multiple elements, or even a string or number.

## Fragments

Sometimes you want to return multiple elements from a component function without wrapping them in a `div` or other element. You can use a `Fragment` (`<></>` or `<Fragment></Fragment>`) for this.

This is necessary because React components can only return a single element from a component function.

```jsx
function UserList() {
  return (
    <>
      <UserCard>
        <Avatar />
      </UserCard>
      <UserCard>
        <Avatar />
      </UserCard>
    </>
  );
}
```

This is equivalent to the following, but the shorthand version above is generally preferred.

```jsx
import { Fragment } from "react";

function UserList() {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <UserCard>
        <Avatar />
      </UserCard>
      <UserCard>
        <Avatar />
      </UserCard>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ The `<Fragment></Fragment>` syntax is only necessary if you want to pass the special `key` prop to the fragment, which will become important when you start working with lists.

> ðŸ’¡ When researching you sometimes might see `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`, which is the same thing.

## Composition

When we build React applications, we often want to build complex components from simpler components. This is called composition.

To do so you need to break down you application into components. You can then compose these components to build more complex components.

It is important to figure out which components you need and how they should be composed. This is called application design.

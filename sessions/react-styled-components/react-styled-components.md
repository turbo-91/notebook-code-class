## What is CSS-in-JS and why do we use it?

CSS-in-JS refers to a collection of ideas to solve complex problems in CSS. There are several libraries which use this approach, one of them is **styled components**. All implementations have in common that they leverage JavaScript as a language for creating styles.

Here's a list of advantages of a CSS-in-JS library like **styled components**:

- automatic critical CSS injected (and nothing more)
- no class name bugs
- easier deletion of CSS
- simple dynamic styling
- painless maintenance
- automatic vendor prefixing

## Styling with styled components

### Basic Styling

To create a styled component,

- import `styled`
- use it to create a styled component like `ListItem`, and
- implement the styled component in the return statement of your component.

```js
//components/List.js
import styled from "styled-components";

export default function List() {
  return (
    <StyledList>
      <ListItem>Item 1</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Item 2</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Item 3</ListItem>
    </StyledList>
  );
}

const ListItem = styled.li`
  background-color: crimson;
`;

const StyledList = styled.ul`
  list-style-type: none;
`;
```

> 💡 Note that the name of a styled component is in uppercase (because it's a component), but must not equal the function name; a common naming pattern is to include the word `Styled`.

### Styling a Custom Component

Sometimes, there already is a component with predefined styles, but you want to further extend them:

- you might have defined a `Button` component with basic styling yourself [see a good example in the docs](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#extending-styles) or
- a framework offers a component you want to use, like the `Link` component from `next/link`:

```js
import styled from "styled-components";
import Link from "next/link";

export default function List() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <li>
        <StyledLink>Let's go somewhere!</StyledLink>
      </li>
    </ul>
  );
}

const StyledLink = styled(Link)`
  text-decoration: none;
`;
```

### Adapting based on props

You can adapt styling based on props. To do so, you need to pass the props to the styled component. Most of the time you'll want to prefix the prop with a `$`. This tells styled components, that the prop should not be passed to the underlying DOM element or component and should only be used for styling.

```js
import styled from "styled-components";

export default function List() {
  return (
    <StyledList $isOnFire>
      <li>Item 1</li>
      <li>Item 2</li>
      <li>Item 3</li>
    </StyledList>
  );
}
```

To use the props to change the styles interpolate a function into the styling template sting. The function receives the props as an argument.

For example, you can use the ternary operator to check whether a property is true or false:

```js
const StyledList = styled.ul`
  list-style-type: ${(props) => (props.$isOnFire ? "🔥" : "❄️")};
  /* or with destructuring: */
  list-style-type: ${({ $isOnFire }) => ($isOnFire ? "🔥" : "❄️")};
`;
```

If you want to set several CSS properties based on the same prop, you can use the `css` helper:

```js
import styled, { css } from "styled-components";

const StyledList = styled.ul`
  ${({ $isOnFire }) =>
    $isOnFire &&
    css`
      list-style-type: "🔥";
      background-color: red;
      color: white;
    `}
`;
```

> 💡 Besides others, the advantages of the `css` helper is syntax highlighting and performance optimization.

### Pseudoelements and Pseudoselectors

To apply pseudoelements, pseudoselectors, or nesting styles, you can use a single ampersand `&` which refers to the component itself:

```js
const StyledLink = styled(Link)`
  text-decoration: none;
  &:hover {
    color: red;
  }
`;
```

### Global Styling

To implement global styling, you'll need to create a global styled component. To keep the structure of the project clear, create a `styles.js` file in the root of the project for this:

```js
// styles.js
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";

export default createGlobalStyle`
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    box-sizing: border-box;
  }
  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, Helvetica,
      Arial, sans-serif, "Apple Color Emoji", "Segoe UI Emoji", "Segoe UI Symbol";
  }
	// more global styles here...
`;
```

Import the `GlobalStyle` component into the `pages/_app.js` file and render it above the `<Component />`:

```js
// pages/_app.js
import GlobalStyle from "../styles";

export default function App({ Component, pageProps }) {
  return (
    <>
      <GlobalStyle />
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </>
  );
}
```

> 💡 There is no consensus as to where to put the `GlobalStyle` component. The decision for a `styles.js` file was made to mirror the fact that, until now, global styles were written in a `styles.css` file.

### Google Fonts GDPR- (DSGVO-) compliant integration

Next.js features the `@next/font` npm package. It will automatically optimize your fonts (including custom fonts) and **remove external network requests for improved privacy and performance** by self-hosting Google fonts.

You need to [install `@next/font` in your project](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization#usage) first. To implement a font family, import it where needed and use it inside the styled component.

The following example sets the font-family in the `GlobalStyle` component for the HTML `body` element:

```js
import { createGlobalStyle } from "styled-components";
import { Open_Sans } from "@next/font/google";

const openSans = Open_Sans({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export default createGlobalStyle`
  // ... some globals styles here...
  }
  body {
    margin: 0;
    font-family: ${openSans.style.fontFamily}; 
    padding: 2rem;
  }
	// ... some more global styles here ...
`;
```

## Why a data fetching library over `useEffect` and `fetch`?

Up to now, you can fetch data using the `useEffect` hook. By doing so, you will need to handle many
things on your own:

- caching fetched data
- refetching programmatically
- implementing an error and loading state
- fetching on interval
- and many more.

A fetching library like `SWR` will provide you with shortcuts for all this tasks.

## How to SWR

### Basic Fetching

In order to use the `useSWR` hook, you first need to create a fetcher function, which is just a
wrapper of the native fetch. A basic example
[recommended by the docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) looks like this:

```js
const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());
```

Then you can import the `useSWR` hook and pass it two argument: the `url` you want to fetch and the
`fetcher` function. `useSWR` returns a `data` object you can use in your JSX.

```js
import useSWR from "swr";

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

function Character() {
  const { data } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1", fetcher);

  // render data
  return <div>Hello {data.name}!</div>; // Hello Luke Skywalker!
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Note that `useSWR` returns an object from which you destructure `data`. This is why you cannot
> simply call the `data` object as you like, but have to rename it according to destructuring rules:
> `{ data: person }`. ðŸ“™ Read more about
> [Getting Started in the docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started).

### Configuring SWR

It can be useful to set some application-wide configuration for `SWR`. You can do so by passing an
config object to the `SWRConfig` component in your `App` (in Next.js that `pages/_app.js`). The following example sets an application wide `fetcher` function and
an application wide `refreshInterval`:

```js
import { SWRConfig } from "swr";

const fetcher = (...args) => fetch(...args).then((res) => res.json());

function App() {
  return (
    <SWRConfig
      value={{
        fetcher,
        refreshInterval: 1000,
      }}
    >
      {/* â€¦ your app */}
    </SWRConfig>
  );
}
```

Setting an application-wide `fetcher` function is very convenient if you want to use the same fetcher function in many
places.

> ðŸ’¡ All following examples will assume an application-wide `fetcher` function configured via
> `SWRConfig`.

### Loading and Error State

The `useSWR` hook provides an `error`, `isLoading` (loading data for the first time) and `isValidating` (anytime data is (re-)loaded) state you can use to create the respective UI
output.

You can destructure them like the `data` object and use them to conditionally return JSX:

```js
function Character() {
  const { data, error, isLoading, isValidating } = useSWR(
    "https://swapi.dev/api/people/1"
  );

  if (error) return <div>failed to load</div>;
  if (isLoading) return <div>loading...</div>;

  // render data
  return (
    <div>
      <span role="img" aria-label={isValidating ? "Validating" : "Ready"}>
        {isValidating ? "ðŸ”„" : "âœ…"}
      </span>
      Hello {data.name}!
    </div>
  );
}
```

The `fetcher` function above does not `throw` an `Error` object for non-`ok` Responses. Throwing is required for SWR to recognize an error and put it into the `error` property of the object returned by the hook.

You can customize the `fetcher` to `throw` an `Error` with additional information (the following
[example is taken from the docs](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/error-handling#status-code-and-error-object)):

```js
const fetcher = async (url) => {
  const res = await fetch(url);

  // If the status code is not in the range 200-299,
  // we still try to parse and throw it.
  if (!res.ok) {
    const error = new Error("An error occurred while fetching the data.");
    // Attach extra info to the error object.
    error.info = await res.json();
    error.status = res.status;
    throw error;
  }

  return res.json();
};
```

This function throws an error with the keys `info` and `status` if the status code of
the response is not in the range of 200-299.

> ðŸ’¡ The advanced `fetcher` above uses two concepts we have not covered:
> [the `new` operator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new)
> and
> [the `throw` statement](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/throw).
> These are advanced JS features we don't need to go into detail by now, but diving into it will
> give you a better understanding of JS as a programming language.
> ðŸ“™ Read more about [Status Code and Error Object](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/error-handling#status-code-and-error-object).

You can use the `error` object to display a more detailed error message (`message` is the string from `new Error()`):

```js
function Character() {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");

  if (error) return <div>{error.message}</div>;
  if (isLoading) return <div>loading...</div>;

  // render data
  return <div>Hello {data.name}!</div>;
}
```

### Fetch on Interval and Button Click

To refetch the API on interval, pass a `refreshInterval` value inside of an option object as an additional
argument to the `useSWR` hook:. In the following example, `SWR` will refetch the API every second:

```js
useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1", { refreshInterval: 1000 });
```

> ðŸ“™ Read more about
> [Revalidate on Interval](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/revalidation#revalidate-on-interval).

To fetch data programmatically (like clicking a button), you can use the `mutate` function provided
by the `useSWR` hook.

```js
function Character() {
  const { data, mutate } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");

  return <RefetchButton onRefetch={() => mutate()}>Refetch data</RefetchButton>;
}

function RefetchButton({ children, onRefetch }) {
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={onRefetch}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

### Data is Cached

`SWR` will cache the fetched data in the browser's memory. This means that if you fetch the same
data twice, the second time it will be loaded from the cache instead of the network. This means that you can use the `useSWR` hook multiple times in your app without
having to worry about fetching the same data multiple times.

```js
function CharacterName() {
  const { data } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");
  return <div>Hello {data.name}!</div>; // Hello Luke Skywalker!
}

function CharacterHairColor() {
  const { data } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");
  return <div>His hair color is {data.hair_color}.</div>; // His hair color is blond.
}

function CharacterHeight() {
  const { data } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");
  return <div>He is {data.height} cm tall.</div>; // He is 172 cm tall.
}

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <CharacterName />
      <CharacterHairColor />
      <CharacterHeight />
    </>
  );
}
```

This application will fetch the data only once, even though the `useSWR` hook is used three times.

Additionally, if you were to manually `mutate` the data (triggering a revalidation), the cache would be updated and the data would be available to all components using the `useSWR` hook with the same key (URL).

This is true even if you were to call `mutate` from yet another component, as long as it has the same key (URL):

```js
function RevalidateButton() {
  const { mutate } = useSWR("https://swapi.dev/api/people/1");
  return (
    <button type="button" onClick={() => mutate()}>
      Revalidate
    </button>
  );
}

// â€¦ other components

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <CharacterName />
      <CharacterHairColor />
      <CharacterHeight />
      <RevalidateButton />
    </>
  );
}
```

### SWR Response API

The `useSWR` hook returns an SWR response object with the following properties:

| response property | description                                            |
| ----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------ |
|            `data` | The data fetched for the given key (URL)               |
|           `error` | An error object if the fetcher function threw an error |
|       `isLoading` | `true` if the data is being loaded for the first time  |
|    `isValidating` | `true` if there is any request or revalidation loading |
|        `mutate()` | A function to mutate the data                          |

## Combine Fetched Data with Local State

With SWR you don't control the state containing the fetched data yourself. Because of this you can't modify the state directly. This is a **good thing** because modifying state that has been fetched from a server is an anti-pattern. If your server gives you data it has to be the single source of truth.

If you want to enrich server data with local state (like attaching an `isFavorite` property to a movie) you can use the `useSWR` hook to fetch the data and the `useState` hook to manage the local state. The local state should be connected to the server data via a unique identifier (like `id` or `slug`).

```js
function Movies() {
  /* let's assume the API return a list of movies like this:
    [
      {
        id: 1,
        title: "Star Wars",
        year: 1977,
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        title: "The Empire Strikes Back",
        year: 1980,
      }
    ]
  */
  const { data: moviesData } = useSWR("/api/movies");

  // initialize the local state with an empty array
  const [moviesInfo, setMoviesInfo] = useState([]);

  function handleToggleFavorite(id) {
    setMoviesInfo((moviesInfo) => {
      // find the movie in the state
      const info = moviesInfo.find((info) => info.id === id);

      // if the movie is already in the state, toggle the isFavorite property
      if (info) {
        return moviesInfo.map((info) =>
          info.id === id ? { ...info, isFavorite: !info.isFavorite } : info
        );
      }

      // if the movie is not in the state, add it with isFavorite set to true
      return [...moviesInfo, { id, isFavorite: true }];
    });
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {moviesData.map(({ id, title, year }) => {
        // find the movie in the state and destructure the isFavorite property
        // if it is not in the state, default isFavorite to false
        const { isFavorite } = moviesInfo.find((info) => info.id === id) ?? {
          isFavorite: false,
        };

        return (
          <li key={id}>
            {title} ({year})
            <button type="button" onClick={handleToggleFavorite(id)}>
              {isFavorite ? "Remove from favorites" : "Add to favorites"}
            </button>
          </li>
        );
      })}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ When using this pattern you are relying on your local state being created ad-hoc. Therefore your local state array will return `undefined` on `find` if the movie is not in the state. This is why we use the `??` operator to default to `{ isFavorite: false }` if the movie is not in the state.

If you use Immer and `useImmer` you can simplify the update code a bit:

```js
function handleToggleFavorite(id) {
  updateMoviesInfo((draft) => {
    // find the movie in the state
    const info = draft.find((info) => info.id === id);

    // if the movie is already in the state, toggle the isFavorite property
    if (info) {
      info.isFavorite = !info.isFavorite;
    } else {
      // if the movie is not in the state, add it with isFavorite set to true
      draft.push({ id, isFavorite: true });
    }
  });
}
```

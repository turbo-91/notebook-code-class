# Challenges: JS Array Methods

## Color Boxes (`forEach`)

(difficulty: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è)

Solve the _Color Boxes (`forEach`)_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/for-each
```

## `map`

(difficulty: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è)

Solve the _`map`_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/map
```

## `filter`

(difficulty: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è)

Solve the _`filter`_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/filter
```

## Repetition: `map`and `filter`

(difficulty: üå∂Ô∏èüå∂Ô∏è)

Solve the _Repetition: `map`and `filter`_ challenge by running this command in your Terminal:

```bash
npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/repetition
```

## `document.querySelectorAll`

Go to this [website](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll),
open the developer tools and then open the JavaScript console.

You can write JavaScript code into the console and execute it.

Use `document.querySelectorAll` to retrieve a list of all `h2` elements on this page.

Log the result to the console and inspect the result.

## Single Page Application

Up until now, we've used several HTML files for our app. In contrast, we can create a SPA
([single-page application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA)): It loads only a
single web document and updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript.

In the following Challenges, there is a dummy SPA of the Quiz App; additionally, there are two
enhanced versions which make use of `forEach` in order to improve and reduce the necessary code.

- SPA 1: a working solution

  ```bash
  npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-1
  ```

- SPA 2: simplified with `forEach`

  ```bash
  npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-2
  ```

- SPA 3: `forEach` within `forEach`

  ```bash
  npx ghcd@latest spicedacademy/fs-web-exercises/tree/main/sessions/js-array-methods/spa-3
  ```

Working in groups, use the Challenges above. Make sure that every student understands every
single line of code and is able to explain it.

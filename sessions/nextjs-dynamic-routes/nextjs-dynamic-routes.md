## Concept of Dynamic Routes

If your app has many possible routes with repeating patterns it would be hard to impossible to create a JavaScript file per route.

Using dynamic routes you can turn (parts of) the path into dynamic parameters using square brackets. If the URL matches the path, Next.js will make the dynamic query parameters available using the `useRouter` hook.

## Implementing Dynamic Routes

To create a dynamic route, you can add square brackets around file or folder names in the pages directory respectively: `pages/movies/[categorySlug]/page/[pageNumber].js`.

The following paths map to this example:

- `movies/romance/page/12`
- - `categorySlug` is `"romance"`
  - `pageNumber` is `"12"`
- `movies/action/page/1`
- - `categorySlug` is `"action"`
  - `pageNumber` is `"1"`
- `movies/comedy/page/3`

  - `categorySlug` is `"comedy"`
  - `pageNumber` is `"3"`

To access the query parameters in a component use the `useRouter` hook imported from `next/router`:

```js
// pages/movies/categories/[categorySlug]/page/[pageNumber].js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function CategoryPage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { categorySlug, pageNumber } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Category Slug: {categorySlug}</p>
      <p>Page Number: {pageNumber}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This of course also applies to a simpler example with a single dynamic query parameter.

```js
// pages/movies/[slug].js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function MoviePage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { slug } = router.query;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Slug: {slug}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ The name of the query parameter always maps to the name of the file/directory: `[slug].js` â†’ `const { slug } = router.query;`

## Linking to Dynamic Routes

You can use the `Link`
component to link to dynamic paths. Use string interpolation with a template string to insert the dynamic query parameters into the path.

Considering a `Movies` component which renders a list of links to all movies, interpolate the `slug` into the path as a query parameter:

```js
import Link from "next/link";

export default function Movies({ movies }) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {movies.map(({ id, slug, title }) => (
        <li key={id}>
          <Link href={`/movies/${slug}`}>{title}</Link>
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}
```

## Imperative Routing

Using `<Link>` is the best option whenever the user navigates through the app on their own. There are
situations, however, where you cannot use a `Link` component because you want to navigate to another
page programmatically. One example of **non-direct** user interaction is changing the page after submitting a form:

```js
import { useRouter } from "next/router";

export default function Form() {
  const router = useRouter();

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    // some data handling â€¦ âœ¨

    router.push("/home");
  }

  return <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>â€¦</form>;
}
```

## next/head component

Next.js comes with a built-in `<Head>` component for appending elements to the head of the page. This
way, you can easily modify the metadata of the page such as the `<title>` HTML tag:

```js
import Head from "next/head";

export default function Movies() {
  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>Movies</title>
        <meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width" />
      </Head>
      <ul>â€¦</ul>
    </>
  );
}
```

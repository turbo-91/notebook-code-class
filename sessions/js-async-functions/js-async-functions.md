## Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code is code that runs in the background. This is useful for tasks that can take a long
time to complete, but don't need to block the main thread.

JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one thing can happen at a time.

Blocking the main thread is bad because it prevents the user from interacting with the page because
no other JavaScript code can be executed. Examples of asynchronous code include: network requests,
file system access, animations and timers.

## Promises

A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
operation, and its resulting value. Most of the time it is returned by a function that performs an
asynchronous operation.

The Promise object has the following properties and methods:

| Property / Method | Description                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state`           | the state of the Promise object, can be `"pending"`, `"resolved"` or `"rejected"`                                                                       |
| `result`          | the result of the asynchronous operation (you'll almost never need to access this directly)                                                             |
| `then()`          | a method that takes a callback function that will be called when the asynchronous operation is complete                                                 |
| `catch()`         | a method that takes a callback function that will be called when the asynchronous operation fails                                                       |
| `finally()`       | a method that takes a callback function that will be called when the asynchronous operation is complete, regardless of whether it was successful or not |

```js
functionThatReturnsAPromise().then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

## Asnyc Functions and the `await` Keyword

Asnyc functions are a syntactic sugar for Promises. Using the `await` keyword, you can write
asynchronous code that looks synchronous. Any function can be prefixed with the `async` keyword:

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  // ...
}

const myAsyncArrowFunction = async () => {
  // ...
};
```

Inside an async function, you can use the `await` keyword to wait for a Promise to be resolved:

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const value = await functionThatReturnsAPromise();
  console.log(value);
}
```

This is can be easier to read than the Promise syntax especially when you have multiple asynchronous
operations that depend on each other.

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  const value1 = await functionThatReturnsAPromise1();
  const value2 = await functionThatReturnsAPromise2(value1);
  const value3 = await functionThatReturnsAPromise3(value2);
  console.log(value3);
}
```

Compared to:

```js
// avoid doing this:
function myFunction() {
  functionThatReturnsAPromise1()
    .then((value1) => {
      return functionThatReturnsAPromise2(value1);
    })
    .then((value2) => {
      return functionThatReturnsAPromise3(value2);
    })
    .then((value3) => {
      console.log(value3);
    });
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ `async` functions always return a Promise. If the function returns a value, the Promise will be
> resolved with that value. Even if you're not using the `return` keyword the function will return a
> Promise that resolves to `undefined` when it reaches the end of it's scope. If the function throws
> an error, the Promise will be rejected with that error.

## Handling Errors

When using Promises, you can use the `catch()` method to handle errors. Using `async` functions, you
can use the `try`/`catch` syntax.

### `try`/`catch`

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const value = await functionThatReturnsAPromise();
    console.log(value);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

The `try` block will be executed, and if an error is thrown, the `catch` block will be executed. The
`catch` block has access to the error that was thrown.

If any error is thrown in the `try` block, the `catch` block will be executed immediately aborting
the execution of any further code in the `try` block:

```js
async function functionThatThrowsAnError() {
  throw new Error("ooops ðŸ«£");
}

async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const value = await functionThatThrowsAnError();
    // The following code will never be executed because
    // `functionThatThrowsAnError()` throws an error.
    // The execution will jump to the `catch` block.
    console.log(value);
    const value2 = await functionThatReturnsAPromise2();
    console.log(value2);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

### `finally`

You can also use a `finally` block after any `try` block to run code after the `try` block is
resolved, regardless of whether it was successful or not:

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const value = await functionThatReturnsAPromise();
    console.log(value);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } finally {
    console.log("done");
  }
}
```

### `try`/`catch` is not limited to `async` Functions

The `try`/`catch`/(`finally`) syntax is not limited to `async` functions, you can use it with any
JavaScript code that might throw an error.

```js
function functionThatThrowsAnError() {
  throw new Error("ooops ðŸ«£");
}

function myFunction() {
  try {
    functionThatThrowsAnError();
    console.log("this will never be executed");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  } finally {
    console.log("done");
  }
}
```

## Parallel Promises

### `Promise.all()`

If you have multiple asynchronous operations that you want to run in parallel, you can use
`Promise.all()`.

`Promise.all()` takes an array of Promises and returns a Promise that resolves to an array of the
results of the Promises in the same order.

```js
async function myAsyncFunction() {
  try {
    const values = await Promise.all([
      functionThatReturnsAPromise1(),
      functionThatReturnsAPromise2(),
      functionThatReturnsAPromise3(),
    ]);
    console.log(values); // [value1, value2, value3]
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

This will run all three asynchronous operations in parallel, and wait for all of them to complete
before continuing. If any of the asynchronous operations fail, `Promise.all()` will fail as well.

### Controlling when to Resolve or Reject Parallel Promises

There are advanced use cases where you might want to control when to resolve or reject a Promise.
`Promise.allSettled()` (does not care if Promises are rejected or resolved) and `Promise.any()`
(resolves once the first Promise is resolved) are two methods that allow you to do that.

## Asynchronous Browser APIs

Here are some examples of asynchronous browser APIs that return a Promise:

- `fetch()` â€” makes an HTTP request and returns a Promise that resolves to a `Response` object
- `element.animate().finished` â€” animates an element and returns a Promise that resolves when the
  animation is complete
- `navigator.getBattery()` â€” gets the current battery level and returns a Promise that resolves with
  the battery level
